# take-home
NOTICE:
NO REFACTORING BEEN DONE ON THE CODE SO AN ADAPTATION TO THE CURRENT CODE BASE IS ADDED AS A TASK 

what's been done:

1-taking note about different behaviors
2-test covering all the existing cases
3-only one case failed : benifit >50 
4-write code (wrapping code inside a condition) so the test won't fail
5-write test for the dafalgan case (degrades in Benefit twice as fast as normal drugs)
6-write code to make the test succeed 
7-run yarn run start (to get an output.json file)
8-manually check if all the values are correct (not needed but done as a precaution)
